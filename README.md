Coozy DPad by Steve Trush
=====================================

Have you ever wanted to change the channel or play a video game without putting down your beer? Now you can! 
Introducing the Coozy DPad - here is a demo: <br>

This is a text entry-device designed for Interactive Device Design (Fall 2017) at UC Berkeley.

What text entry technique you chose and why:

How you implemented character recognition (i.e., how your code works):

How you constructed the physical device:

Reflection: 
I learned quite a bit through this assignment. Even though I had soldered wires before (mostly in building radio antennas), this was my first time building an actual electronic device. While I found actually building the breadboard circuit fairly simple (granted it is a simple 6-switch design with pull-up resisters), I saw how, upon considering various form factors, the construction of the physical device can quickly become complicated.
